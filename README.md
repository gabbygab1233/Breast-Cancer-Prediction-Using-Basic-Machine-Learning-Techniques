# Breast Cancer Prediction
Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.

# Problem:
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. The most common cancers are:

* Lung (2.09 million cases)
* Breast (2.09 million cases)
* Colorectal (1.80 million cases)
* Prostate (1.28 million cases)
* Skin cancer (non-melanoma) (1.04 million cases)
* Stomach (1.03 million cases)

The most common causes of cancer death are cancers of:

* Lung (1.76 million deaths)
* Colorectal (862 000 deaths)
* Stomach (783 000 deaths)
* Liver (782 000 deaths)
* Breast (627 000 deaths)

# Description

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
